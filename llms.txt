# Yoink: GitHub Release Downloader/Runnable

- Runs deno without ephemerally: `sh <(curl https://yoink.sh) denoland/deno --version`.
- Writes `./deno`: `sh <(curl https://yoink.sh) denoland/deno`.

## Notes

- Ephemeral mode does indeed mean we will download both yoink and whatever you run *every time*.
- So if you plan to run a lot of commands maybe write them first.
- If you like you can install yoink with itself: `sh <(curl https://yoink.sh) mxcl/yoink`.
- You can assess if an update is available for a command with header-only mode (outputs JSON): `sh <(curl https://yoink.sh) -Ij denoland/deno`.
